# Twitter-Api
You should have a twitter developers account to run the code. If you don't have one, create one.
Make a new file in same directory with name : "tw_cred.py" and its content will be :

API_KEY = "XXX"                 #XXX IS YOUR API KEY
API_SECRET_KEY = "XXX"          #XXX IS YOUR API SECRET KEY
ACCESS_TOKEN = "XXX"            # ' ' ' ' '  ACCESS TOCKEN
ACCESS_SECRET_TOKEN = "XXX"     # ' '' ' ' ' ' 

Contact at google hangout : htv.vid@gmail.com, if you are intrested in code and want to know how it would work.
